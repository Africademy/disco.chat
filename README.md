# disco.chat

disco.chat adds anonymous and ephemeral real-time chat to any webpage. It's a mashup of Twitch.tv's chat and Intercom's customer service chat widget.

**I gave up on this side project, but feel free to poke around, do whatever you want.** 

A company called [Spot.im](https://spot.im) does a similiar thing (I think).

Be gentle. Be nice.

## The Problem

- Publishers are absolutely desparate for new ways to boost engagement/pageviews
- Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter have centralized the web (sadly), but discussions (i.e. comments) are still effectively asynchronous on their core web platforms 
- Chat services like Discord have been able to grow communities (some around publisher content) via real-time chat
- Publishers have limited ways to monetize these hand raisers and/or be part of the discussion

## The Solution

disco.chat adds anonymous and ephemeral real-time chat to any webpage. It's a mashup of Twitch.tv's chat and Intercom's customer service chat widget.

### The Rules

**Chat anonymously and ephemerally with other readers.**
- No user data is collected
- Each URL is it's own chat room
- Messages only live until you refresh the page

## Vision / Roadmap

- Add more spiffy entrance animation for the widget
- Add a "Chat with other readers here" or "Join the conversation" speech bubble above the widget so that people know what this thing does
- Maybe 1:1 chatroom-to-URL isn't the right model, perhaps there should just be topics like a Slack setup
- Add Ability to browse and switch rooms / URLs
- Browser testing. Lol?
- Look into AWS's IoT thing that could be repurposed as a secure message bus for chat
- Build out a publisher UI for managing topics/URLs/chats
- Payments?
- Analytics?
- Typing indicators would be nice.
- Move to GraphQL?
